# Are you still talking?

When I'm chairing a session at .Astronomy 8 or some other conferece, I don't want to have to look at my watch. I want to just set a timer and the onus is on the speaker.

Use a [blink(1) light](https://blink1.thingm.com/) to control your speakers when you are chairing a session.

You will need a blink(1) light and python. Is that too much to ask? (maybe)

## Installation instructions
```
python setup.py install
```
